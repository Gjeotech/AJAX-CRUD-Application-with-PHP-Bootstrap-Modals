# AJAX-CRUD-Application-with-PHP-Bootstrap-Modals
This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system using PHP, MySQL, jQuery AJAX, and Bootstrap modals. The application allows users to manage staff records — adding, updating, viewing, and deleting entries — all without reloading the page.

====Features=======

Display all data dynamically using AJAX.
Update existing entries with a modal-based form.
Delete records with confirmation prompts.
Fully asynchronous (no page reloads).
Responsive, modern UI powered by Bootstrap 4.

=====Technologies Used======
PHP (PDO) – Server-side scripting and database communication
MySQL – Database for storing staff details
jQuery AJAX – Asynchronous data requests
Bootstrap 4 – UI styling and modal components
HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript – Frontend structure and interactivity
